// useReducer Hook

/*
üîπ The `useReducer` hook is used to manage complex state logic in React functional components.

üìå Syntax:
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
challenges: recreate the syntaxt with reflection 10 times.
1. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
2. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
3. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
4. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
5. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
6. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
7. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
8. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
9. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
10. const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
- `reducer`: A pure function that receives the current `state` and an `action` object, and returns the updated state based on the action type.
- `dispatch`: A function used to send an action to the reducer. When you call `dispatch`, React runs the reducer with the current state and the dispatched action, then updates the state with the reducer‚Äôs return value.

‚ú® In essence, the reducer function acts as a blueprint that describes how the state should change in response to different actions.
