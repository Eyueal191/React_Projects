// 1. useState Hook

/*
ðŸ”¹ The useState Hook is used to create a state in functional components.
    - It stores dynamic data that can change over time.
    - Whenever the state changes, the component automatically re-renders to reflect those changes.

ðŸ”¸ What kind of data is stored in state?
useState is commonly used to store:

1. User state      â†’ Data provided by the user (e.g. form input) that needs to be rendered or sent to a backend.
2. Backend state   â†’ Data received from a backend/API that needs to be displayed in the UI.
3. Loading state   â†’ Boolean state used to show a loading indicator while fetching data.
4. Error state     â†’ Used to store error messages if data fetching fails.

ðŸ§  In simple terms:
useState helps manage any piece of data that needs to be shown in the UI and can change due to user actions or backend responses.

Got it! Hereâ€™s a set of **30 questions** about the **useState hook** based on your description, divided into True/False, MCQ, and Fill-in-the-Blanks to help you master the fundamentals.

# **True or False (10 questions)**

1. `useState` is used to create and manage state inside functional components.
2. Changing the state with `useState` does not cause the component to re-render.
3. You can only store primitive values like strings and numbers with `useState`.
4. `useState` can be used to manage loading state in an application.
5. Backend data fetched from an API is commonly stored in state using `useState`.
6. The state created by `useState` can only be updated once during the component's lifecycle.
7. The initial state value passed to `useState` can be a function that returns the initial value.
8. `useState` returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.
9. State updates via the setter function returned by `useState` are asynchronous.
10. State created with `useState` is local to the component and cannot be accessed directly by other components.

1. The React hook used to create and manage state in functional components is called `__________`.
2. `useState` returns an array where the first element is the `__________` and the second element is a `__________`.
3. When you call the state setter function, React schedules a `__________` of the component.
4. You should use `useState` to store dynamic data that needs to be shown in the `__________`.
5. To update state based on the previous state, you can pass a `__________` to the setter function.
6. `useState` can store any JavaScript data type, including objects, arrays, and `__________`.
7. The `__________` state is used to show a spinner or progress indicator while waiting for data.
8. State is local to a component, meaning it cannot be accessed directly by `__________` components.
