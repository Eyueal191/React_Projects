// 6. useMemo Hook

/*
üîπ The `useMemo` Hook is used to **memoize the result of a computation**.

It helps **optimize performance** by **caching expensive calculations** so they are **only re-evaluated when their dependencies change** ‚Äî rather than on every render.

üìå Syntax:
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

üî∏ How the dependency array works:

1. ‚úÖ Empty array `[]`:
   ‚Üí The value is computed **once** on initial render and never recalculated.

2. ‚úÖ With dependencies `[a, b]`:
   ‚Üí The function is only re-executed when **one of the dependencies changes**.

3. ‚ùå Without `useMemo`:
   ‚Üí The computation will re-run **on every render**, potentially slowing down your app.

---

üî∏ Common Use Cases:

1. ‚úÖ **Expensive Computations**
   ‚Üí When you need to perform CPU-intensive operations (e.g. filtering, sorting, or heavy math).
   ‚Üí Example: Filtering a large list only when the search input changes.

2. ‚úÖ **Referential Equality for Props**
   ‚Üí Prevents unnecessary re-renders when passing computed values to memoized components (`React.memo`).
   ‚Üí Example: A sorted array passed to a child component.

3. ‚úÖ **Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders**
   ‚Üí Works with memoized child components that only re-render if their props change by reference.

üß† Summary:

`useMemo` is your go-to tool for:
- **Optimizing expensive calculations**
- **Avoiding recomputation on every render**
- **Stabilizing derived values** to prevent unnecessary renders

‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember:
- Don‚Äôt overuse it ‚Äî only use it when there is a **clear performance bottleneck**.
- The dependencies must cover **all variables used in the memoized function**.

# **True or False (10 questions)**

1. `useMemo` is used to memoize values, not functions.
2. `useMemo` can help avoid expensive recalculations on every render.
3. You must include all external dependencies inside the dependency array.
4. Omitting the dependency array means the value is recomputed on every render.
5. An empty dependency array means the value is computed only once.
6. `useMemo` returns a memoized function.
7. `useMemo` is ideal for caching async API calls.
8. `useMemo` ensures that a value doesn‚Äôt change unless its dependencies change.
9. `useMemo` and `useCallback` are interchangeable.
10. `useMemo` helps avoid unnecessary renders by stabilizing computed prop values.
