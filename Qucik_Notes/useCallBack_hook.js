// 5. useCallback Hook

/*
üîπ The `useCallback` Hook is used to **memoize functions** in React.

When you pass a function as a prop to a child component, it can trigger unnecessary re-renders unless the function identity is stable. `useCallback` helps avoid that by **returning a memoized version of the function** that only changes when its dependencies do.

üìå Syntax:
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // function logic
}, [dependency]);

üî∏ How the dependency array works:

1. ‚úÖ Empty array `[]`:
   ‚Üí The function is memoized **once** and stays the same across renders.

2. ‚úÖ With dependencies `[value1, value2]`:
   ‚Üí The function is recreated **only when one of the dependencies changes**.

3. ‚ùå Without `useCallback`:
   ‚Üí A **new function** is created on **every render**, which can cause child components to re-render unnecessarily.

---

üî∏ Common Use Cases:

1. ‚úÖ **Preventing unnecessary re-renders**
   ‚Üí Especially important when passing callbacks to child components wrapped with `React.memo()`.

2. ‚úÖ **Stable function references in event handlers**
   ‚Üí Avoids reattaching event handlers unnecessarily.

3. ‚úÖ **Using functions as dependencies in `useEffect`**
   ‚Üí Ensures the function reference is stable and doesn't cause infinite loops.

üß† Summary:

`useCallback` is your go-to tool for:
- **Memoizing event handlers or callbacks**
- **Improving performance** when functions are passed as props
- **Maintaining stable function identity** between renders

‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember:
- Use it only **when necessary**‚Äîpremature optimization can add unnecessary complexity.
- The dependencies must include **everything the function uses from outside its scope**.

# **True or False (10 questions)**

1. `useCallback` returns a memoized version of a function.
2. You should always use `useCallback` for every function in your component.
3. The dependency array tells React when to recreate the memoized function.
4. If you pass an empty dependency array, the callback never changes.
5. `useCallback` is helpful when passing functions to memoized child components.
6. Using `useCallback` always improves performance, no matter what.
7. A new function is created on each render if `useCallback` is not used.
8. `useCallback` is similar to `useMemo`, but specifically for memoizing values.
9. A memoized function with `useCallback` still has access to updated state or props.
10. The callback returned by `useCallback` is re-created when dependencies change.

# **Multiple Choice Questions (10 questions)**

1. What does `useCallback` do?
   a) Memoizes the return value of a function  
   b) Memoizes the function itself  
   c) Memoizes a component  
   d) Renders a callback  

2. When should you consider using `useCallback`?
   a) To avoid calling a function  
   b) To prevent unnecessary function recreations  
   c) To cache data from an API  
   d) To mutate the DOM directly  

3. What does the dependency array in `useCallback` control?
   a) The arguments the function receives  
   b) When the function is executed  
   c) When the memoized function is recreated  
   d) The return value of the function  

4. If you omit the dependency array in `useCallback`, what happens?
   a) The function is never updated  
   b) The function updates after every render  
   c) An error is thrown  
   d) React ignores the callback  

5. Which hook works closely with `useCallback` for performance optimization?
   a) useState  
   b) useRef  
   c) React.memo

   d) useCallback and useRef  

10. In which situation is `useCallback` LEAST helpful?
    a) Passing functions to deeply nested components  
    b) Inline event handlers in simple components  
    c) Custom hooks with internal callbacks  
    d) Optimizing child component rendering

6. Without `useCallback`, a `__________` function is created on each render.
7. `useCallback` is often used with the `__________` function to optimize component rendering.
8. You should include all `__________` used inside the callback in the dependency array.
9. Overusing `useCallback` can lead to unnecessary `__________` in the codebase.
10. `useCallback` only re-creates the function if one of the `__________` has changed.
